Build a modern and responsive Movie Center Website (like Netflix or Disney+) called "Movie Night" using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router. Follow best practices in code structure, accessibility, design, and performance.
This app will allow users to browse and explore movies in a visually appealing way, using mock data from @movies.json file (mocks the @TMDB API response: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).

      - Top Rated
      - Action Movies
      - Comedy Movies
      - Documentaries
    - Responsive layout with smooth horizontal scrolling.

    - Overview/description, release date, genre tags, rating, votes.
    - Option to "Watch Trailer" (opens modal or video preview --> you can embed any Youtube video just for demo).
